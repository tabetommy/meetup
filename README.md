GIVEN the user was typing ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù in the city textbox. And the list of suggested cities is showing, WHEN the user selects a city (e.g., ‚ÄúBerlin, Germany‚Äù) from the list,THEN their city should be changed to that city (i.e., ‚ÄúBerlin, Germany‚Äù).And the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city

## Lessons learned

- I learnt about serverless functions and implemented one with Amazon web service to generate tokens to fetch data from google calendar API
- I also learnt about a test driven approach to developement and implemented Unit, Intergrated, User Acceptance and End-to-End testing
- I learnt and successively converted the app to a progresive web app by implementing a service worker and configuring the JSON manifest file.
- Finally, i used a Rechart Js to plot charts.
